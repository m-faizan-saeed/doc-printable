# Automated ID Card Layout & Enhancement Tool

Developed a Rust-based application that streamlines the ID card photocopying process by automatically arranging processed ID photos onto an A4 layout. Implemented image enhancements such as contrast adjustment and subject-focused cropping, and generated a printable PDF containing eight evenly spaced copies with dotted cut guides—significantly reducing paper waste and manual effort.

## Details will be added soon. ;-)
